README

There are 2 code files: chess.c and gerateW.cpp . 
chess.c is our A.I program. Common C programming IDE can use it.

genrateW.cpp is the program we use to generate the weight of each position, in line 167, you can set running time. For different running time, the result shall be different, be careful when it comes to use.

10moutput.txt is the result generated for 10 million times.

100koutput.txt is the result generated for 100 thousands times.

Other folders: easy, mediam, hard recorded the process of each games.

While using chess.c, pay attention to the note in main(), by marking some lines(419-448), you can let A.I play with itself.
